    "# Week #6 - The finite element method - Static problem\n",

    "It is one of the oldest numerical methods. At the beginning people\n",
    "were interested in using it for describing the movement and forces\n",
    "of buildings.\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea is, for example, consider a building that one is interested\n",
    "in analyzing and divide it into several bins. Right after, consider\n",
    "all the beams which might be exercising force on it. These connections\n",
    "between the bin which is being analyzed and those at its surrounding\n",
    "is called *assembly*. Mathematically, this approach gives us linear\n",
    "system equations to be solved. According professor Igel, it was the\n",
    "first method which allowed us to solve very complex geometries. Like\n",
